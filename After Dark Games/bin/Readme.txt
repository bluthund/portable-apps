II. GENERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES
----------------------------

Users of After Dark 4.0:
The After Dark Games screen saver can be found in the 
Display Properties Screen Saver tab. The screen saver
will not reside in the After Dark tab of your Display Properties.

Why don't the game icons show up in the Start Menu?
After you restart your machine, the icons will appear.

How do I uninstall After Dark Games?
The easiest way is to Open Control Panels from the Settings
in the Start Menu and double-click on "Add/Remove Programs".
Select After Dark Games and click Add/Remove button.  

Why doesn't the Maximize Button work?
When After Dark Games is launched, the window is already at 
its full size, but is not "maximized". When the window is
maximized you can't resize it. At full size, you can grab its
corners to make it smaller and get it out of the way, and
then quickly return to full size using the maximize button.

Why does the Sleep button disappear?
In your Display Properties control panel, there is
a Screen Saver tab. If you click the After Dark Games Sleep button,
you will engage the screen saver set in the Screen Saver tab.

How do I turn off my screen saver?
During installation, you may have chosen to install the After Dark
screen saver. If you decide to turn off the screen saver, follow 
these steps:
1. Click on the Start button in the taskbar.
2. Choose "Settings" from the menu.
3. Choose "Control Panels".
4. Choose "Display".
5. Click on the "Screen Saver" tab.
6. In the Screen Saver box, choose a different screen saver or choose "None".
7. Click OK.

Can I play from my Zip drive?
If you install and play After Dark Games from a zip disk,
game play may be choppy.



III. GENERAL GAME ISSUES
------------------------
Hula:
On slower machines, Hula Girl platforms will appear to stutter.
