Extracting file from disk image
Extract is a file in disk image extraction utility. An image is a file which 
contains all the floppy data (file, FATs, boot sector, directory...). You can 
create an image file with WinImage (a Windows 3.1 or Windows NT 
shareware I wrote which create and manage image file, and has a large
superset of Extract functionnality) and a lot of Dos based disk copy 
utility : Wimage (in FdFormat utility) from C.H. Hochstätter, DrDos 6 and 
OS/2 2.x diskimage utility, DCF (Disk Copy Fast) from Chang Ping Lee, 
CopyVit from Sebastien Chatard, DF (Disk Image File Utility) from Mark Vitt, 
Super-DiskCopy from Super Software, SabDu from S.A. Berman, 
Disk-RW from K. Hartnegg, DiskDupe (from Micro System Design), internal disk 
image utility from Microsoft and Lotus and MFMT sample Windows NT application 
on the Windows NT SDK.

80 % of the diskcopy tools which can make image I test are compatible 
with Extract and WinImage.

Extract is a freeware, but if you like this software, you can send me

Windows 3.1 and Windows NT shareware I wrote with a superset of 
Extract functionnality.

Extract syntax is based on PKZIP/PKUNZIP and ARJ model.
First parameter must be -i, -it, -l, -e, -o, -x, -oe or -ox. If the first 
parameter is the image filenale, the -l (list option) is selected.
Second parameter is the image filename. You can use wildcard with 
Joker, and Extract use all the file it find with this joker.
Third parameter is optionnal. It is the location where you want extract 
your file. You must begin this parameter with x:, where x is the drive. If 
you give only subdirectory name, extract don't consider it as a extract 
location information.

And after (if first is not -i or -it), you can specify somes wildcard 
for choose files in images. You don't specifiy it, Extract use all 
file in the image. If first is -i or -it, they specifie file you want 
inject in image. (or -Fxxx to specifie the format of the image you want build)
