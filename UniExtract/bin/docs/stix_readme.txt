STIX extracts files from InstallShield 3 - Archives.
STIX also extracts files from Installshield Selfextracting executables.

Usage:

  STIX <source> <target directory>

  <source> is DATA.Z or DATA.1 in most cases.
  if the archive is split across multiple files, STIX will continue
  unpacking them.

  This version of STIX no longer needs TTDECOMP and can restore
  date and time stamp of unpacked files.
