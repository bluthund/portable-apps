TrID is a utility designed to identify file types from their binary
signatures. While there are similar utilities with hard coded rules,
TriID has no such rules. Instead, it is extensible and can be trained
to recognize new formats in a fast and automatic way.
TrID uses a database of definitions which describe recurring patterns
for supported file types.

You can help creating new definitions!
Just run the TrIDScan module against a number of files of a given type.
The program will do the rest.

See the website for more info & changes log!


Required System: Windows (just about any version)
