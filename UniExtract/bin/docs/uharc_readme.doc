 ===< 1. Introduction >========================================================


  UHARC is a high performance file archiver. This package contains 7 files:

    LICENSE.DOC    License information
    UHARC.EXE      program version for Win32 systems
    UHARCD.EXE     program version for Dos32 systems
    UHARCSFX.EXE   Sfx-Stub for Win32 systems
    UHARC.DOC      this documentation file
    UNUHARC.EXE    free extraction program for Win32 systems
    UNUHARCD.EXE   free extraction program for Dos32 systems

  What's new in version 0.6b ?

    - free extraction programs for Win32/Dos32 added - these programs can be
      used and distributed freely without any restrictions

  Note: UHARC 0.6b archives are compatible with v0.6 and v0.6a archives but
        NOT compatible with any previous version (version number < 0.6)!

  This program will run on any 386 or better computer. Memory requirements
  depend on selected compression mode. The number of files in one operation
  is only limited by available memory, however current version can't handle
  archives with more than 2 GB total unpacked size.



 ===< 2. Usage >===============================================================


  Usage: UHARC command [-switch..] archive[.uha] [file..@listfile..!exclude..]

  Commands:
  ~~~~~~~~~
    a   Create archive/Add files           e   Extract files to current dir
    m   Create archive/Move files          x   Extract files with full path
    l   List files in archive              t   Test files in archive

  Switches:
  ~~~~~~~~~
    ac[-,+]     Clear file archive attr    ae<attr>  Set attr exclusion mask
    b<n>        Set max filebuffer size    bpb[-,+]  bpb instead of % ratio
    d<0..2>     Set display mode           ed[-,+]   Store empty directories
    idle        Set idle process priority  lg<file>  Log output to <file>
    m<0..3,x,z> Set compression mode       md<n>     Set dictionary size
    mm[-,+]     MM-detection on/off        o[-,+,p]  Set overwrite mode
    pw[passwd]  Set password               p<-,r,f>  Set path handling
    r[-,+]      Recurse subdirectories     t<dir>    Set extract target dir
    vm[-,+]     Set virtual memory usage   y[-,+]    Assume yes on all queries


  * For commandline help type "UHARC" without any parameter.

  * The command character must be placed immediately after "UHARC".

  * The switches, if any, must follow the command character. UHARC supports
    the use of either "-" or "/" as the switch option character.

  * The UHARC archive name must be the first filename on the commandline.
    If there is no archive file extension specified, UHARC will add the
    default (".UHA") extension.

  * After the archive filename come the list of files for the given
    operation. One or more files containing a list of files to process
    can also be used by prefixing the list's filename with "@". It's
    possible to mix filenames and list files in any order. If a filename
    on commandline or in a list file has prefix "!", this means it will
    be excluded in processing. Allowed delimiters for filenames in list
    files are space, tab and newline. Filenames with spaces must be
    enclosed in double-quotes. The line size in list file must not
    exceed 4095 characters.

  * Filename wildcards are allowed in commandline and in list files,
    but not for archive filename. The use of wildcards follow MS-DOS
    convention. "*.*" means all files. "*.txt" means all files with an
    extension of ".TXT". "?B*.*" means all files with a second character
    of "B".

  * If there are no files specified at all, all files ("*.*") will be
    processed (use "-r" to recurse subdirectories).

  * UNUHARC versions have same commandline options like UHARC but support
    extraction and test commands only.



 ---< 2.1. Commands >----------------------------------------------------------


   a    Create archive and add matching files.
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        If a file with the archive name already exists, UHARC will ask
        before overwriting this file, unless you change the default
        overwrite mode or use "-y".

        Following switches have effect: ac ae b bpb d ed lg m md mm o p pw r y


   e    Extract matching files to current directory.
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Stored pathnames will be ignored. Using the switch "-t", you can
        change the current directory for extracting.

        Following switches have effect: b d lg o pw t y


   l    List matching files in archive.
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Using switch "-y", UHARC will not pause after one page, else you
        can use the following keys:
             ESCAPE      =  Cancel (quit program)
             TAB         =  Disable pause
             RETURN      =  Next line
             other keys  =  Next page

        Using switch "-d2", filenames are not shortened and more
        information are displayed.

        Following switches have effect: b bpb d lg pw y


   m    Create archive and move matching files.
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        If a file with the archive name already exists, UHARC will ask
        before overwriting this file, unless you change the default
        overwrite mode or use "-y". If compression was successful, UHARC
        will delete matching files on disk (but no directories).

        Following switches have effect: ae b bpb d ed lg m md mm o p pw r y


   t    Test integrity of ALL files in archive.
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Following switches have effect: b d lg pw y


   x    Extract matching files with full pathnames.
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        UHARC will use the pathnames stored in archive for extraction (if
        the archive was created with option "-pf", this also includes drive
        letters). Using the switch "-t", you can select the root-directory
        for all extracted dirs/files.

        Following switches have effect: b d lg o pw t y


   Note:  During all operations it's possible to terminate the process
          by pressing ESCAPE and answering the following question with
          "Y" (when listing files, there is no additional query).



 ---< 2.2. Switches >----------------------------------------------------------


  --           Stop switches scanning
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               This switch tells UHARC that there are no more switches to be
               processed. It's necessary if the archive name starts with a
               "-" character. Without "--" switch such name would be treated
               as a switch.


  -!<char>     Set exclude mask specifier
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               Defines the character that is used as exclude mask specifier.
               It should be used if a file name given in commandline or in
               list file starts with the default exclude mask character "!".
               If no character is given ("-!") then exclude mask processing
               will be disabled. This option should be used carefully.

               DEFAULT: -!!


  -@<char>     Set list file specifier
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               Defines the character that is used as list file specifier.
               It should be used if a file name given in commandline or in
               list file starts with the default list file character "@".
               If no character is given ("-@") then list file processing
               will be disabled. This option should be used carefully.

               DEFAULT: -@@


  -ac[-,+]     Clear file archive attribute
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 -ac[+]  Clear archive attribute of files stored in archive.
                 -ac-    Don't clear archive attribute.

               If this option is enabled and compression was successful,
               UHARC will clear the archive attribute of all files which
               are stored in archive (directories are not affected).

               This option has effect with add command only.

               DEFAULT: -ac-


  -ae<attr>    Set attribute exclusion filter
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               Defines the filter for exclusion based on file attributes.
               Files are excluded if specified attributes are set "+" or
               cleared "-". File attributes are:

                 "A"     archive attribute
                 "H"     hidden file attribute
                 "R"     read-only attribute
                 "S"     system file attribute

               Example: switch "-aeA-H+" means that files with archive
               attribute cleared or hidden attribute set are not included
               in the processing list.

               This option has effect with add or move commands only.

               DEFAULT: not specified


  -b<n>        Set maximum file buffer size (in KB).
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               After allocating all structures for (de)compression the
               remaining memory is used for file buffers, but never more
               than <n>. The minimum buffer size is 50 KB.

               DEFAULT: -b1024


  -bpb[-,+]    Show bpb instead of % ratio
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 -bpb[+] Show compression ratio in bpb.
                 -bpb-   Show compression ratio in %.

               DEFAULT: -bpb-


  -d<0..2>     Set display mode.
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 -d0     Quiet mode (no process information, except queries).
                 -d1     Display some process information.
                 -d2     Show more information (file info, verbose listing).

               DEFAULT: -d1


  -ed[-,+]     Store empty directories
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 -ed[+]  Store also empty directories.
                 -ed-    Don't store empty directories.

               This option has effect with add or move commands only.

               DEFAULT: -ed-


  -idle        Set idle process priority (Win32 only)
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               This option forces UHARC to set its process in IDLE priority
               class, which means UHARC is executed as background task with
               only small effect on normal system operation (assumed there
               is enough memory available). This way UHARC can process very
               large data sets without blocking the system for long time.

               DEFAULT: not specified


  -lg<file>    Log UHARC output to specified <file>.
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               If UHARC fails to open <file>, no log is created (without an
               error message). The display mode setting has effect on log,
               too.

               DEFAULT: no log file


  -m<0..3>     Set compression mode.
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 -m0     Store files without compression.
                 -m1     Use ALZ:1 (fast) compression mode.
                 -m2     Use ALZ:2 (norm) compression mode.
                 -m3     Use ALZ:3 (best) compression mode.
                 -mx     Use PPM compression mode.
                 -mz     Use LZP compression mode.

               ALZ uses advanced LZ77 compression algorithm with arithmetic
               entropy coder. "-m1" is the fastest ALZ mode, sacrificing
               compression ratio to gain better speed. Mode "-m3" achieves
               best compression and needs most time. "-m2" is a compromise
               ratio/speed and is used as default mode. The decompression
               speed is nearly the same for all ALZ modes and it is much
               faster than compression.

               PPM mode uses an order-4-2-1-0 model with preliminary LZP
               pass. In most cases this mode provides the best compression
               results.

               LZP mode uses the same dictionary compression as in PPM mode
               but with much simpler order-1-0 literal model.

               There are also two extra modes (may be not supported in
               future versions):
                 -mr     Use simple RLE compression.
                 -mw     Use LZ78 with selectable dictionary size.

               DEFAULT: -m2


  -md<n>       Set maximum dictionary size (in KB).
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               If dictionary is disabled, this setting has no effect.
               Valid sizes:
                 -m1..3,-mx,-mz   n = power of 2 from 1 to 32768 or "a".."p"
                 -mw              n = power of 2 from 1 to 32    or "a".."f"

               A one-character shortcut can be used instead of size number,
               e.g. "-mda" instead of "-md1" or "-mdk" instead of "-md1024".

               Dictionary size selection:
                 1. Using option "-md<n>", UHARC will never select a
                    dictionary size greater than <n>. If "-md<n>" is not
                    used, UHARC will try to use default dictionary (n=4096).
                 2. If data stream size is smaller than <n>, UHARC will use
                    the smallest dictionary size which is greater than the
                    data stream.
                 3. If there is not enough memory for current selection,
                    UHARC will use the largest dictionary size which is
                    possible with available memory.

               DEFAULT: -md4096


  -md[-,+]     Disable/enable dictionary-based compression.
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               This has effect only with modes "-m1", "-m2", "-m3" and "-mx".

                 -md[+]  Enable dictionary-based compression.
                 -md-    Disable dictionary-based compression.

               Generally, it's NOT RECOMMENDED to disable dictionary-based
               compression. Without dictionary, the compression ratio is
               almost always worse. But for some data types (e.g. waveform
               sounds or photographic true-color pictures), the compression
               isn't affected much by dictionary. Using "-md-" in such cases
               will speed up the compression process considerably.
               If dictionary-based compression is disabled, there are nearly
               no differences between the three modes "-m1", "-m2" and "-m3".

               DEFAULT: -md+


  -mm[-,+]     Disable/enable built-in multimedia detection/compression.
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 -mm[+]  Enable multimedia detection/compression.
                 -mm-    Disable multimedia detection/compression.

               UHARC multimedia detection/compression supports many data
               types (8/16-bit mono/stereo waveforms, 24-bit true color
               pictures and many other types using 8/16/24/32-bit record
               sizes). It's also possible to detect multimedia-like data
               in other file types (e.g. in executables). Therefore it's
               NOT RECOMMENDED to disable multimedia detection/compression
               unless the user knows, that there is absolutely no chance
               to use multimedia compression (e.g. compressing text only).

               DEFAULT: -mm+


  -o[-,+,p]    Set overwrite mode.
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 -op     Prompt user before overwriting files.
                 -o[+]   Always overwrite files without asking.
                 -o-     Never overwrite existing files.

               Using -op with -y has the same effect as -o[+].
               If UHARC shows an overwrite query, the user can select one of
               the following options:
                 "Y"     Yes, overwrite current file.
                 "N"     No, don't overwrite current file.
                 "A"     Always Yes, overwrite current file and auto-answer
                         all following overwrite queries with "Y".
                 "C"     Cancel, don't overwrite and quit process.

               DEFAULT: -op


  -p<-,r,f,e>  Set path mode.
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 -p-     Store no paths (exclude paths from names).
                 -pr     Store relative paths.
                 -pf     Store full paths including drive letter.
                 -pe     Store relative paths but exclude all paths
                         specified in commandline or in list file.

               Using option "-pr", paths are stored in relation with the
               current directory of each drive (drive letter isn't stored).
               With option "-pf" it's possible to backup data from different
               drives into one archive and restore all data correctly.
               Option "-pe" is the same as "-pr" but any path specified in
               commandline or list file is excluded from the path stored in
               archive.

               DEFAULT: -pr


  -ph[-,+]     Archive header encryption
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 -ph[+]  Encyrpt archive header.
                 -ph-    Don't encyrpt archive header.

               The archive header contains folder and file names, sizes etc.
               of the complete archive. If this header is encrypted then the
               correct password is needed even to read the archive content.

               DEFAULT: -ph+


  -pw[passwd]  Set encryption password
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 -pw     Request user to enter password.
                 -pw<s>  Use "s" as password.

               With switch "-pw" the user is requested to enter the password
               twice for safety reasons (input will not be echoed on screen).

               DEFAULT: not specified


  -px          Pause before program exit
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               This switch tells UHARC to wait for a key stroke before exit.
               It could be useful if the console window will be closed
               automatically after program finish.


  -r[-,+]      Set subdir recursion mode.
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 -r[+]   Recurse subdirectories.
                 -r-     Don't recurse subdirectories.

               If recursion is enabled, matching files are also searched
               in all subdirectories (regardless of directory names and
               attributes) of all specified directories (commandline and
               list files).

               DEFAULT: -r-


  -sfx[stub]   Create self-extracting archive (Win32 version ONLY !).
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               With this option UHARC will create a self-extracting archive
               (SFX). A self-extracting archive is a Win32 executable with
               appended UHARC archive. Running a SFX archive without any
               options will extract ("x" command) the archive content to
               current directory. The SFX program supports "x", "e" and "t"
               commands for any UHARC archive (self-extracting and normal
               ones) with same command-line options as UHARC program. Other
               commands are not supported.

               [stub] is an optional parameter specifying the stub program
               used to create the SFX archive. By default stub UHARCSFX.EXE
               is used which must be located in current directory or in the
               directory where UHARC.EXE is running from.

               The SFX option is applicable only if new archive is created.
               The following DOS command can be used in order to transform
               an existing UHARC archive into SFX:
                 COPY /B UHARCSFX.EXE+"archive.uha" "archive.exe"


  -t<dir>      Set extract target directory.
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               UHARC will store all extracted files in directory <dir>.
               If <dir> doesn't already exist, UHARC will create it.

               Using this option with the "e" command, <dir> will be the
               'current directory' for extracting. Using this option with
               the "x" command, <dir> will be the root-directory for all
               extracted dirs/files.

               DEFAULT: not specified


  -vm[-,+]     Set virtual memory usage
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 -vm[+]  Use virtual memory.
                 -vm-    Don't use virtual memory.

               With virtual memory usage disabled UHARC checks free physical
               memory at program start and will not use compression modes
               that require more memory. Proper work of this option is not
               guaranteed if it is used in multitasking systems.

               DEFAULT: -vm-


  -y[-,+]      Set auto-answer mode.
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 -y[+]   Assume YES on all queries.
                 -y-     Don't auto-answer queries.

               Using the option -y[+], all queries, except critical error
               messages, don't appear on screen and are auto-answered
               with "Y".

               DEFAULT: -y-



 ---< 2.3. Environment variable >----------------------------------------------


  It's possible to define default options in the environment variable
  "UHARC_OPT". Whenever UHARC is executed, it first looks for this
  environment variable and parses the values of this variable like
  commandline switches. Any arguments in the environment variable
  can be overridden on the commandline.

  Example:
  ~~~~~~~~
    SET UHARC_OPT=-d2 -p- -lgc:\uharc.log

    When UHARC is next executed, it will use verbose display mode,
    store no paths and log all outputs to file "C:\UHARC.LOG" by default.

  Note:  If the environment variable contains a log file switch, it's
         not possible to disable log file directly. Use instead the switch
         "-lgNUL" on commandline. This overrides the default log file and
         write all log outputs to the NUL file (effective no output).



 ===< 3. Examples >============================================================


  1.    UHARC a archive *.dll @c:\list *.exe

    This will compress all "*.DLL", "*.EXE" and the files listed in the file
    "C:\LIST" to the archive file "ARCHIVE.UHA" using the default compression
    mode.


  2.    UHARC a -m3 -r -pf -o backup.arc c:\*.ini d:\*.ini c:\*.cfg d:\*.cfg

    This will compress all "*.INI" and "*.CFG" files on drives "C:" and "D:"
    to the archive file "BACKUP.ARC" using the ALZ:3 compression mode. UHARC
    will store full paths including drive letter, so it will be possible
    to restore all files on correct drives. If a file named "BACKUP.ARC"
    already exists, UHARC will overwrite this file without asking.


  3.    UHARC m -mz -md64 -mm- -r text c:\text\*.txt

    This will move all "*.TXT" files in "C:\TEXT\" and its subdirectories
    to archive file "TEXT.UHA" using LZP mode with max 64K dictionary and
    without multimedia detection/compression.


  4.    UHARC l -d2 -lguharc.lst archive a*.doc b*.doc

    This will verbosely list all "*.DOC" files with a first character of
    "A" or "B" in archive file "ARCHIVE.UHA" and log the output to file
    "UHARC.LST".


  5.    UHARC x -y arc.uha

    This will extract all files in archive "ARC.UHA" with full paths. All
    queries, except critical error messages, will be auto-answered with YES,
    so if one of the files already exists, UHARC will overwrite this file
    without asking the user.


  6.    UHARC e -td:\temp archive readme.txt

    This will extract the file "README.TXT" from archive "ARCHIVE.UHA" to
    the directory "D:\TEMP\". If this directory doesn't already exist,
    UHARC will create it.


  7.    UHARC e -o- sounds @mysounds.lst

    This will extract all files listed in "MYSOUNDS.LST" from archive
    "SOUNDS.UHA" to the current directory. UHARC will not overwrite
    existing files.


  8.    UHARC t -d2 -lglog archive

    This will test the integrity of all files in archive "ARCHIVE.UHA" and
    log the verbose output to file "LOG".


  9.    UHARC a -m3 -r -sfx MyGame "Games\My Favourite Game\*.*"

    This will compress the complete content of "Games\My Favourite Game\"
    folder (including all subfolders) to the self-extracting archive file
    "MyGame.exe" using the ALZ:3 compression mode.
    Note: SFX and long file names are supported in Win32 version only!
