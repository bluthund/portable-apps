  bbColor3dc v1.3

  bbColor3dc is a plugin for Blackbox for Windows
  copyright © 2004-2009 grischka


  Description:

  According to the current blackbox style, bbColor3dc searches
  and applies a "3DC" set of system colors as generated by 3DCC
  (3D Color Changer) to the windows GUI.


  bbColor3dc looks for a 3DCC color scheme in the following locations:

  - In the style itself, immediately preceeded by a commentline
    containing "3dc" and the stylename or "start"

    Example: ! -- minimal.3dc --
             6781065
             ...

         or: ! -- 3dc theme start --
             6781065
             ...


  - In a separate file with the name of the style and
    the extension ".3dc" in three locations:

      - in the directory of the style itself
      - in a subdirectory "3dc" from where the style is located.
      - in a subdirectory "3dc" from the Blackbox directory.

    Examples:
      Current style:  "styles\misc\minimal"
      3DC file:       "styles\misc\minimal.3dc"
      or              "styles\misc\3dc\minimal.3dc"
      or              "c:\blackbox\3dc\minimal.3dc"


  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Alternatively:

  If no 3dc file is found, bbColor3dc sets some colors from the
  current style similar to the BBColor plugin by qwilk and NC-17.

  Colors are set for:
      - Window Caption Bar
      - Menu Hilite Bar
      - ToolTips


  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Installation:

  1. Put bbColor3dc.dll somewhere in the blackbox\plugins folder.
  2. Load it from the plugin-config menu, or add it's relative path
     to "plugins.rc".

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Broadcast Messages:

  bbColor3dc recognizes the following Broadcast Messages:

    @BBColor3DC.Read <filename.3dc>

        Makes bbColor3dc set colors from the specified 3dc-file.
        Also disables default behaviour until cleared with:


    @BBColor3DC.Clear

        Reverts to the colors set before bbColor3dc has been loaded.


    @BBColor3DC.Keep

        This will keep the current set, even when bbColor3dc is unloaded.


    @BBColor3DC.Write <filename.3dc>

        Makes bbColor3dc write out the currently set system-colors
        to a 3dc-file as specified.


    -------------------------------------
    And for those who like experimenting:

    @BBColor3DC.SetColor <ITEM> #XXXXXX

        Sets the color for the specified ITEM, where ITEM can be one of:

        3DDKSHADOW 3DSHADOW 3DFACE 3DFACEALT 3DLIGHT 3DHIGHLIGHT
        ACTIVECAPTION GRADIENTACTIVECAPTION CAPTIONTEXT ACTIVEBORDER

        example: @BBColor3DC.SetColor 3DFACE #CC0000



    @BBColor3DC.GetColor <ITEM> @<Broadcast_Message %s>

        Makes bbColor3dc send a Broadcast Message with %s in the message
        replaced by the color for the specified ITEM.

        example:
        @BBColor3DC.GetColor 3DFACE @BBCore.message The '3DFace' Color is %s
